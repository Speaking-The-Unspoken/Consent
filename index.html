            <p class="intro">Consent is often simplified as “saying yes or no,” but in reality, it is much deeper. True consent is informed, enthusiastic, voluntary, and revocable. It's an ongoing mutual agreement that recognizes the dignity and autonomy of individuals.</p>
        </div>

                <h3>Here is what everyone knows</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>In India, consent is frequently manipulated, ignored, or even violated through cultural, social, and legal mechanisms. People preach, "Only a YES is a YES”, but our society begs to differ. Even a "yes" often comes with fine print approved by patriarchy, stamped by society, and notarized by fear.</p>
                <p>Arranged marriages for "family honor" are called consensual, but the deck is stacked against individuals. The "yes" is often bought with an invisible currency: fear of shame, fear of dishonor. And still, we label it consent and call it progress.</p>

                <h3>On The Topic Of Moral Policing</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>One of the starkest examples is the concept of “Love Jihad," a politically charged myth suggesting interfaith marriages are acts of coercion. Despite constitutional rights, consenting adult couples face harassment from families, vigilante groups, and even state machinery.</p>
                <p>Consent is overwritten by communal anxieties. The Bajrang Dal and other groups are often involved in this “Moral Policing." Ironically, two adults holding hands are scrutinized, while forced marriages—where no real consent exists—are celebrated as tradition.</p>

                <h3>Beyond Pre-Marital Relationships</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>Even after marriage, consent ideally never vanishes. Yet, marital rape is not a crime in India. Section 63 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita implies consent is given forever in a marriage. A woman's “no” can become invalid in her own home.</p>
                <p>This reflects a persistent mindset: women's bodies are seen as the property of their husbands. Domestic abuse thrives on a culture of silence, where victims are pressured to “adjust” rather than assert their autonomy.</p>

                <h3>The Grey Area of Consent</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>Among teenagers especially, manipulation is rampant. Guilt-tripping, promises of love, or threats of a breakup are often used to pressure consent. This involvement of emotions and social power makes consent harder to define legally.</p>
                <p>However, both partners share responsibility. A simple, clear "NO" can prevent a world of misunderstanding and trauma. A verbal response is a practical step to prevent a long line of issues from ever arising.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="cta-section fade-in">
            <h3>Before We Leave: A Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Consent must be understood as the non-negotiable foundation of any healthy relationship and society. Acknowledging it means affirming every individual’s inviolable right to choose.</p>
            <p><strong>So here is what we ask of you:</strong> Educate others. Ask people to speak out and voice their decisions. Make them realize they are the sole person in control of their bodily and emotional autonomy.</p>
